_It's a time to learn "How to Make Almost Anything!"_
_We had a great Session About What is Fab lab and Convinced us "How to Make Almost Anything"_.
_We got an idea about How to Document our Work Properly and had a session about Github Page creation._


### What is Fab lab ?
_A fab lab (fabrication laboratory) is a small-scale workshop offering (personal) digital fabrication.A fab lab is typically equipped with an array of flexible computer-controlled tools that cover several different length scales and various materials, with the aim to make "almost anything". This includes technology-enabled products generally perceived as limited to mass production._
### Do you Know Who is  Neil Gershenfeld?
