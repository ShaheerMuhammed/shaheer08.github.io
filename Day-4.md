I started with Laser Cutter , I was thinking about to design a keychain with my name on it , and I choose my picture to engarve that on a carboard. there are two types of functions by using a laser cutter, they are cutting and engraving. the function determined by system configuration such as power , speed and image type whether it is rastor or vector.
