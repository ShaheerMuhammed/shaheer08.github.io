### Day-7

   In day 7 we were deal with screen printing , casting and moulding.  
 
### Screen Printing

  Screen printing is a printing technique whereby a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil. A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed.
  
- Steps

  - Make a stencil contain what to be printed

  - stencil can make using vinyl cutter as already seen before

  - then paste on a squre frame 

  - then place that frame where we want print

  - transfer ink to that and drag up and down 

  - then wait until its getting Dry

  
  
### Casting & Molding

   Casting is a manufacturing process in which a molten material is introduced  into a solid mold and allowed to solidify. The solid material takes the shape of the mold. The term usually refers to metals but can also apply to the same process for other materials. Ceramics can be "slip cast" and polymers can also be cast. Molding refers to shaping a material that is soft but not fully liquid. (Think wet clay, for instance) Molding as a process might also use a mold to shape the soft material, but doesn't necessarily require one.
