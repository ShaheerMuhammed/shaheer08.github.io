 ## Electronics Production 
   
   In electronics production we designed a simple circuit and constructed its board and schematic file to be milled from shopbot and to make a pcb. Circuit consist of two LED's controlled by a mini microcontroller and includes resistors and capacitor to make the circuit long life 
 
- Steps 
 
  - Design Circuit Using Eagle

  - add required libraries like fab.lbr

  - then add components using add command

  - choose smd type component

  - after adding give names for components by using name command

  - then type label on command bar inorder to visible name of the component

  - then join components using wires

  - after finishing the circuit

  - choose board from sketch/board
     
  - then make a fine adjustemnts 

  - then load and test its 100% possible

  - then choose layer option from edit view
